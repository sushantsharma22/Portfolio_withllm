# ðŸš€ Mobile-Optimized Portfolio

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### ðŸ”§ Mobile-First Optimizations
- **Adaptive Star Field**: Reduces stars from 200 to 50 on mobile devices
- **Frame Rate Control**: 30fps on mobile vs 60fps on desktop
- **Simplified Animations**: Removes complex transitions on small screens
- **Smart Device Detection**: Uses `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` to detect low-end devices

### âš¡ Performance Features
- **Service Worker**: Caches resources for faster loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Heavy animations disabled on mobile/low-end devices
- **GPU Acceleration**: Key elements use `transform: translateZ(0)` for hardware acceleration
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

### ðŸ“± Mobile-Specific Changes
- **Static Background**: Very low-end devices get simple CSS gradient instead of canvas
- **Disabled Effects**: Particle systems, AI animations, and heavy background effects disabled on mobile
- **Simplified UI**: Complex title animations replaced with static display on mobile
- **Optimized Canvas**: Shorter trails, fewer shooting stars, reduced mouse tracking

### ðŸŽ¯ Performance Targets
- **Desktop**: Full experience with all animations
- **Tablets**: Reduced particle effects, maintained starfield
- **Mobile**: Minimal animations, optimized starfield
- **Low-end**: Static background, essential animations only

## Device Detection Logic
```javascript
isMobile: window.innerWidth < 768
isLowEnd: navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4  
isVeryLowEnd: navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 2 || window.innerWidth < 480
```

## Deployment Notes
- All heavy animations are conditionally loaded
- Service worker caches critical resources
- Fallbacks provided for all interactive elements
- Performance monitoring included in console

Perfect for GitHub Pages deployment! ðŸŒŸ
